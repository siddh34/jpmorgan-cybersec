# Datascience & Cybersec Tasks from JPMorgan

## Task1

For the first module of this project, we will need you to accomplish the following:

Set up your system by downloading the necessary files, tools and dependencies.
Explore the financial payment services dataset by completing the querying and data visualization exercises in the Additional Resources below
We've broken down the steps for you in stages below so you can accomplish this task in an organized manner.

Set Up:
Before you can tackle any software or development task you need to set up your development environment. Your development environment refers to your system having all the required software installed to modify the code, as well as getting the code of the project itself onto your computer.

To do this we've created a simple guide below on how to get your environment set up: Task1_setup.md

      2. Purpose:

Being able to query and visualize large datasets helps provide critical information for which areas need additional investment. This is not limited to financial systems but internal computer information systems as well.

     3. Acceptance Criteria:

Using the Pandas library, you learned how to explore and make sense of a dataset. In the process, you wrote queries and then visualized those queries in an easily digestible format that is presentable to management.

## Task2

We have curated a set of resources for you to go over. Feel free to skip around. The goal is for you to pick up some familiarity with security principles, not necessarily the exact details.

Start with https://owasp.org/Top10/. The following are in scope A01, A02, A03, A04, A06, and A07. We recommend reading the description section and then one of the attack scenarios.
Then, go through https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/security/. Itâ€™s ok if not everything makes sense but try to get a general sense of how web frameworks think about security.
You are now prepared to work through the quiz. The last question of the quiz is a bonus and relates to the next item.
If you have time after the quiz, you will have the opportunity to enhance the security of a Django web application as a bonus activity. The instructions are in Task2_handson.md and the starter files are in mysite.zip.
Acceptance Criteria: You have submitted the quiz on website

## Task3

For the third module of this project, we will need you to accomplish the following:

Set up your system by downloading the necessary files, tools and dependencies.
Develop a machine learning model that classifies emails into two categories.
We've broken down the steps for you in stages below so you can accomplish this task in an organized manner.

Set Up:
Before you can tackle any software or development task you need to set up your development environment. Your development environment refers to your system having all the required software installed to modify the code, as well as getting the code of the project itself onto your computer.

To do this we've created a simple guide below on how to get your environment set up: Task3_setup.md

    2. Purpose:

The objective of this task is to learn about the stages of developing a machine learning model. This is applied in the context of email security, which is something that all organizations need to be cognizant of.

    3. Acceptance Criteria:

Using scikit learn, you were able to develop a machine learning model that classified emails into two categories. First, you had to preprocess the dataset so that it was in a format that the model could be trained on. Then, you selected the appropriate classifier for the task at hand. Then, you analyzed a variety of statistics to see how well the model performed. Finally, you looked under the cover of the machine learning model to see what it had learned.

Estimated time for task completion: 1 hour depending on your learning style.
